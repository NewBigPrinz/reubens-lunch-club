# Reuben's Lunch Club

## Purpose

This is a site for project 1 of the Code Institute curriculum. The site is based on a fake deli/catering business which is a genuine aim of mine in later years. The business is named after my eldest son.

## Strategy

Food is very much a face-to-face business so the main purpose of the site would be to provide information on the food and services offered, rather than eliciting subscriptions and/or sign-ups. The site does need to be mobile-first. As a user, I very rarely look for places to eat, menus and/or recipes on desktop.

## Design

The main page of the website is designed to contain all relevant information that somebody would reasonably look up about a business; opening times, services etc. There is a contact page as required by the project, although this is good practice anyway. The third page gave reason to treat the business as a going concern from a content standpoint. The crux of the business is that the 'special' is king but as these would potentially tied to holidays or just prove unpopular in a real environment, those recipes that would not be repeated either due to unpopularity or because of their association with a particular event, could be posted to a page for people to recreate themselves.
